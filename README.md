# Treatment Challenge

### Considerations

To implement the desired outcome for this challenge, i have chosen to develop my program using a design pattern.
The design pattern chosen for this project was the Chain of Responsibility:
 
https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_Responsibility 

In my understanding i consider this design to be very flexible and consistent as it allows future additional matches of new medicines and patient conditions, easily added to the program.

Also by using this design pattern i believe it allows the developer to add new behaviors to the chain of responsibility or even
to better assist it by using other design pattern to provide for the chain of responsibility pattern (ex: strategy pattern).  

There are multiple design strategies that could also be very well suited and even more elegant for the project but i consider this approach to be 
very flexible if needed.
